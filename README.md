This is just a project I made to practice basic linear algebra and technical AI knowledge that I learned while taking Andrew Ng's machine learning specialization course.
There is unfortunately no documentation or exceptions, also only the bare bones features of a neural network are included.
Note: train and test functions MUST be a numpy array of n training points (could be one, but must have that extra dimension included). I know, it's not great.
Additionally, the function used for prediction is forward_prop, not predict. Train function only does one epoch, manually create a loop to do multiple.
This is also one of my first times actually publishing a "finished" product onto GitHub so please give any feedback.

This is just a project I made to practice basic linear algebra and technical AI knowledge that I learned while taking Andrew Ng's machine learning specialization course.
Note: train and test functions MUST be a numpy array of n training points (could be one, but must have that extra dimension included).
Additionally, the function used for prediction is forward_prop, not predict. Train function only does one epoch, manually create a loop to do multiple.
Please give any feedback.
